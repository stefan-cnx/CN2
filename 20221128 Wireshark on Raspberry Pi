Wireshark on Raspberry Pi
=========================

1.) Install
-----------
1. Login to the bash terminal of the Raspberry Pi.
2. Install Wireshark by running these commands:  
   sudo apt update  
   sudo apt upgrade -y  
   sudo apt install wireshark  
   => you may get a message informing that 
      this application can not be upgraded as the lastest version is installed  
3. Use the 'exit' command to close the bash terminal.  

   
2.) FTP Server
--------------
We will use vsftpd as our preferred FTP server.
1. Ensure you have started a SSH session with your server.
2. Install vsftpd Server by running these commands:  
   sudo apt update  
   sudo apt upgrade -y  
   sudo cp /etc/vsftpd.conf /etc/vsftpd.conf.orig  
   => This will create a backup copy of the vsftpd configuration file.  
      Might come in handy in the future.
3. ... now we'll start playing a little ...
   sudo apt install vsftpd
